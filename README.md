# Time-addressable Media Store API

This repository contains API definitions for a Time-addressable Media Store (TAMS) server, which can be used to store, query and access segmented media - distinct from files and streams, but sharing characteristics of both.

BBC R&D have demonstrated use of the TAMS approach as part of composable, software-defined workflows which can run in the cloud, on-premise or in a hybrid environment.
We've built a prototype implementation of this API, along with services for movement and transformation of streams and files, which serve as the media backend for other projects such as our [remote wildlife camera](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2022-04-video-cloud-media-store-ingest-service) work.

Time-addressable media is defined by a timeline, with media elements placed upon it, building upon concepts familiar from IMF.
Media stored in TAMS are identified with UUIDs according to the scheme used in [AMWA NMOS IS-04](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/releases/v1.3.2/APIs/schemas/).
Once written, the media, and their association with the timeline, are immutable.

Thanks to this immutability, a UUID and a timerange always refers to a specific sequence of media.
Unless you need to read the samples, you donâ€™t need to copy the media, instead just working by reference.
Metadata operations can all be carried out without moving media files around, so lightweight metadata operations can have lightweight implementations.

We designed TAMS cloud-first.
When run on public cloud services TAMS benefits from the scalability, robustness and availability of any well-designed cloud service.
Freed from the limitations of a fixed-size appliance, the TAMS can become the core of a whole media ecosystem.
Next-generation tools and systems communicate via, or with reference to, the store, just by making HTTP requests.
Immutability means that references are always valid.
Wide availability means large organisations like the BBC can easily share assets between staff and partners.
Access controls can be put in place as needed for business reasons, using standard web security techniques, rather than being imposed by technical limitations.

Thanks to adopting cloud-style separation of concerns, essence storage is delegated to a cloud service.
As a result storage can be chosen on a flexible and dynamic basis.
Media can be moved between locations and storage tiers as needed.
Users of TAMS are insulated from the details of the underlying storage.

## Documentation

- OpenAPI Specification: [TimeAddressableMediaStore.yaml](./api/TimeAddressableMediaStore.yaml)
- Rendered Documentation: [https://bbc.github.io/tams](https://bbc.github.io/tams)

This repo contains some automation to run a mock version of the API using [Stoplight Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism).
To run the mock server using Docker, try something like the command below (or run `make mock-server-up`):

```shell
docker run --rm --init --name mock-tams -v "$(pwd)":/data:ro -p 4010:4010 stoplight/prism mock /data/TimeAddressableMediaStore.yaml -h 0.0.0.0
```

A mock API server will start at <http://localhost:4010>

## Design

The store handles Flows which exist on an infinite timeline, are immutable, and can be grouped by Sources (based on the Flows and Sources in the [AMWA NMOS MS-04 model](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-04/releases/v1.0.0/docs/2.1._Summary_and_Definitions.html)).
A flow ID and timerange refers to a sequence of grains (_e.g._ frames of video or set of audio samples) and any point in a Flow can be uniquely addressed by a `<flow_id, timestamp>` tuple.
This unique address is guaranteed to refer to a specific frame, or set of audio samples, so it can be safely passed around other tools or programs.
At any time the unique address can be exchanged for the media data by an API call.
But if that is not needed, media work can be done purely by reference.

Grains are grouped into Flow Segments, containing for example one second of content, wrapped in a container format such as MPEG-TS.
The store provides a mechanism to upload and register new Flow Segments, and an interface to request all the Flow Segments covering a particular timerange and their download URLs; an approach inspired by chunked streaming protocols like HTTP Live Streaming.

The media data contained within Flow Segments may be stored separately from the metadata linking them to a position on the timeline, separating the media data and metadata planes.
For example our implementation uses a database (_e.g._ Amazon DynamoDB) to store Flow Segment metadata and an object store (_e.g._ AWS S3) to store the media data for Flow Segments.
We refer to media data stored in the object store as 'media objects'.
The Flow Segment has a single S3 download url which is the location of the media object that contains the stored media data for the Flow Segment.
When writing to the store, the S3 URLs can be passed to a client permitting them to upload media data directly.

Another advantage of separating the media data and metadata planes in this way is that a particular Flow Segment can be referenced by multiple flows.
On the metadata side, the Flow Segment is just a URL, so any number of flows can record that same URL against other `<flow_id, timestamp>` tuples.
This allows for copy-on-write semantics: immutability means a new Flow must be created to make changes to existing parts of the timeline, but for unmodified portions of the timeline the new `<flow_id, timestamp>` tuple points to the existing object ID.

The Flow model is aligned with the principles and schemas of [AMWA NMOS IS-04](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/releases/v1.3.2/APIs/schemas/) to facilitate easy integration of NMOS-compliant media devices.

### Reading and Writing in the Store

The process of reading from the store is:

1. Client identifies the Flow ID and timerange of interest
2. Client makes a request to [`GET flows/<flow_id>/segments?timerange=<timerange>`](https://bbc.github.io/tams/#/operations/GET_flows-flowId-segments) and receives a list of Flow Segments, including their timeranges and download URLs
3. Client downloads each URL, concatenates the Flow Segments together and unwraps the grains within
4. The first and last Flow Segment may contain more grains than requested, so the client should skip any received not in the requested timerange

The process of writing to the store is:

1. Client creates a Flow if necessary by making a request to [`PUT flows/<flow_id>`](https://bbc.github.io/tams/#/operations/PUT_flows-flowId)
2. Client makes a request to [`POST flows/<flow_id>/storage`](https://bbc.github.io/tams/#/operations/POST_flows-flowId-storage) with the timerange to be written
3. Store responds with a list of Flow Segment timeranges and URLs to PUT media data into, along with an optional `pre` URL to call before writing
4. If a `pre` URL was given, client calls it
5. Client breaks content into Flow Segments as instructed and uploads it
6. Client makes requests to [`POST flows/<flow_id>/segments`](https://bbc.github.io/tams/#/operations/POST_flows-flowId-segments) with details of each new Flow Segment created, to register them on the timeline

### Flows, Sources and Mutation

Flows in the store are assumed to be immutable: once a grain has been written to a point on the timeline on a specific Flow, it cannot be changed.
However Flows can always be extended, with empty spaces on the timeline filled in, and areas of the timeline can be permanently erased.

When it becomes necessary to mutate content, for example reversioning content or performing production operations, the Flow ID (and potentially Source ID) will change.
Various scenarios are explored in the [Practical Guidance for Media](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-04/releases/v1.0.0/docs/3.0._Practical_Guidance_for_Media.html) section of AMWA MS-04.

### API Versioning

The API is versioned using a major and minor version number.
A breaking change - such as removal of a feature, or renaming of properties in such a way that would break compatibility (including fixing a typo) - results in a major version increment and the minor version is reset to 0.
Features such new endpoints or new (optional) data properties result in a minor version increment.
Other changes such as documentation changes do not result in version updates.
Note that the version may change frequently whilst the API is still under development!

Versions are calculated automatically upon release using 'magic' strings included in commit messages:
    - `sem-ver: api-break` - where a breaking change is made (results in a major version bump)
    - `sem-ver: feature` - where a new feature has been added (results in a minor version bump)
    - `sem-ver: deprecation` - where an existing feature has been marked as deprecated, but not yet removed (results in a minor version bump)
Commits without one of these magic strings are assumed to be unsubstantial and will not result in a version bump.
Versions will only be incremented once when a release is made.
If there are multiple commits since the last release, the major version number will be incremented by 1, and minor version set to 0 if at least one of the commits contains an `api-break`.
If there are no `api-break` changes since the last release, the minor version will be incremented by 1 if at least one commit contains a `feature` or `deprecation` change.
Otherwise, the version will not change.

It is possible to see what the version would be if a release was made at the current commit by running `make next-version` in the top directory of this repository.

## Proposals, Decisions and Architecture Changes

This repository uses [(M)ADR documents](https://adr.github.io/madr/) to propose significant changes, facilitate discussions and decision making, and to store a record of options that were considered.
These documents may be found in the [docs/adr/decisions](./docs/adr/decisions/) directory, and are managed as described by the [ADR Readme](./docs/adr/decisions/README.md).

## Making a release

Run the `release` workflow under the `Actions` tab on this repository on GitHub against the `main` branch.
This workflow requires approval.
This workflow will fail if it does not identify any commits that would result in a version bump (see [API Versioning](#api-versioning)).
