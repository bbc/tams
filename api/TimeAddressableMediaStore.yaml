  title: Time-addressable Media Store
  description: |
    The Time-addressable Media Store (TAMS) is used for storing segmented media flows.
    The TAMS consists of a media store for the media flow segment objects and a service providing
    a database index of the flow segments. This document is a specification of the service API.

    See the [bbc/tams](https://github.com/bbc/tams) repository for more background on TAMS.

    **Note**: the examples provided in this specification are for a system which uses a media
    store that provides HTTP URLs for uploading and downloading media objects in buckets. This
    could for example be implemented using an AWS S3 compatible store using presigned URLs or by
    a simple file system storage with an HTTP frontend. Clients should parse the /service endpoint
    and handle the media store type in use appropriately.

        Availability of this endpoint is indicated by the name "webhooks" appearing in the `event_stream_mechanisms`

        Making a POST request to this endpoint with the same URL, API key name and value but a different list
        of `events` SHOULD update the existing registration. POSTing an empty list of events SHOULD remove the
        registration.

        HTTP requests from the service SHOULD include a `api_key_name` header with the 'api_key_value' value. Clients SHOULD verify this against the value they provided when registering the webhook.

        API implementations SHOULD consider the security implementations of providing webhooks, and include appropriate
        mitigations against Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks and similar.

      description: |
        Returns the flow segments.

        The flow segment provides information about the media object. The media store type, which is
        indicated in the /service resource, determines the information that is included to allow the
        flow segment's media object to be downloaded. The examples provided here are for the
        "http_object_store" media store type which MUST include a `get_urls` property that contains the
        HTTP URLs for downloading the media object - server implementations should generate this internally.

        The flow segment may include timing and timerange adjustment information that the client needs to
        apply when extracting the samples from the media object.
        - If `sample_count` is set, the timerange of samples must be `sample_offset` to
         `sample_offset + sample_count` (exclusive). Otherwise, the timerange of samples must be
          `sample_offset` until the end.
        - The sample timestamp in the flow segment (`segment_ts`) is the timestamp in the media object
          (`media_object_ts`) adjusted by `ts_offset`: `segment_ts = media_object_ts + ts_offset`. The
          `segment_ts` should equal the start of the `timerange` for the sample at `sample_offset`.

        Use the pagination options to limit the results to a timerange and/or count. The list of flow
        segments can be empty. A request for segments from a non-existent flow will return an empty
        list, not a 404.

        Note that for codecs with temporal re-ordering, the timerange representes the _presentation_
        timeline, and clients may need to check the `key_frame_count` property and/or read backwards
        from the start of the requested timerange to retrieve enough reference material to start
        decoding.

        When making requests to the provided `get_urls`, clients should include credentials if the provided
        URL is on the same origin as the API itself, akin to the `same-origin` mode in the
        [WhatWG Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode).

      summary: Create Flow Segment
      description: |
        Register a new flow segment, attaching the object id given to a point in the flow timeline.

        The segment may use a newly-written object, or re-use an existing object from another flow.

        For newly-written objects, the client is responsible for ensuring that the segment written to the store obeys the following restrictions:
        - The object id provided for a segment MUST be one which was received in a POST from /storage for this flow.
        - All samples in the object SHOULD be used by the segment.
        - The timestamps of each sample in the media object MUST equal its position on the Flow timeline, OR `ts_offset` MUST
          be set such that `media_object_ts + ts_offset = segment_ts`
        - The timerange of the segment MUST NOT overlap any other segment in the same Flow.
        - The `sample_offset` SHOULD be zero.

        Clients are expected to decide how to break content into media objects, however those objects SHOULD be large
        enough to avoid excessive round trip overheads in the underlying store (_e.g._ of the order of several megabytes)
        and where codecs with temporal re-ordering are used, object SHOULD contain complete GOPs or decodable units.

        For objects that have been re-used from other flows, the `sample_offset` and `sample_count` MAY be used to
        specify part of the object to use:
        - The `timerange` field indicates the new segment's position in the flow
        - The sample associated with the start of the `timerange` MUST be the one selected by `sample_offset`
        - Likewise, the sample associated with the end of the `timerange` MUST be the one selected by
          `sample_offset + sample_count - 1`, unless `timerange` has an exclusive end, in which case it will be
          `sample_offset + sample_count`.
        - The timerange of the segment MUST NOT overlap any other segment in the same Flow.

        Allocate storage locations for writing media objects.

        The media store type, which is indicated in the /service resource, determines the information provided
        in the response. The examples and description below are for the "http_object_store" media store type.
        This media store type provides HTTP URLs for uploading and downloading media objects in buckets.

        The response will include a PUT URL that a client uses to upload the media object. The client is expected
        to register the flow segment using the /flows/{flowId}/segments endpoint once the upload is complete.
        Implementations need to handle situations where objects were uploaded but no flow segment was registered
        successfully.

        The response may include PUT URLs for creating buckets for the media objects. These PUT URLs should
        be used before uploading media objects. The object_id associated with each storage location has the
        bucket name as its prefix.

        The response may include PUT URLs for setting the CORS properties for the buckets and media objects.

        When making requests to the provided `put_url`, clients should include credentials if the provided
        URL is on the same origin as the API itself, akin to the `same-origin` mode in the
        [WhatWG Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode).

        List deletion requests currently being worked on, for monitoring in development.

        This will not necessarily list all requests, nor return a consistent set in any particular order,
        and should not be relied upon by clients. However if there are any requests in the system, it will
        always return at least one.

        Get information about a timerange of FlowSegments that are being deleted.

        A deletion request is created when a client DELETEs a long timeranges of segments, which takes longer than
        a single HTTP request. Clients will be redirected here to monitor the request's progress.
