  title: Time-addressable Media Store
  description: |
    The Time-addressable Media Store (TAMS) is used for storing segmented media Flows.
    The TAMS consists of one or more Storage Backends for the media Flow Segment Objects and a service providing a database index of the Flow Segments.
    This document is a specification of the service API.

    See the [bbc/tams](https://github.com/bbc/tams) repository for more background on TAMS.

    **Note**: the examples provided in this specification are for a system which uses a Storage Backend that provides HTTP URLs for uploading and downloading Media Objects in buckets.
    This could for example be implemented using an AWS S3 compatible store using presigned URLs or by a simple file system storage with an HTTP frontend.
    Clients should parse the [/service](#/operations/GET_service) endpoint and handle the Storage Backend type in use appropriately.

        Availability of this endpoint is indicated by the name "webhooks" appearing in the `event_stream_mechanisms`
        list on the service endpoint.

        HTTP requests from the service SHOULD include a `api_key_name` header with the 'api_key_value' value. Clients SHOULD verify this against the value they provided when registering the webhook.

        API implementations MAY partially support event filtering and transformations.
        API implementations SHALL return a 400 response code if the filtering or transformation specified in the request is not supported.

        API implementations SHOULD consider the security implementations of providing webhooks, and include appropriate mitigations against Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks and similar. API implementations SHOULD take appropriate steps to authorize the modification of existing webhooks. This may take the form of RBAC, or ABAC.

      description: |
        Create or replace the Flow metadata.

        Clients should aim to populate as many of the Flow metadata fields as possible and practical. The fewer parameters that are set, the higher the likelihood that reading clients will have to retrieve the media to determine technical metadata to e.g. configure decoders.

        Some parameters may be ignored/overridden by service implementations. This is to enable the Flow json-blob to be re-used with no/minimal editing in various use cases. Such parameters are called out in their description.

        Service implementations SHOULD verify that Flow metadata is compatible with the associated Source.
        Service implementations MAY accept modification/addition of parameters, and reflect such changes in the Source, where it will not bring any Flows of the Source into conflict.
        Where metadata would result in any Flow of the Source coming into conflict, the request SHOULD be rejected with a 400 response.
        Examples of conflicting metadata include `format` not matching, or the `role` in `source_collection` and `flow_collection` not matching.
        It may also be possible for service implementations to detect some instances where multiple Flows should not be considered of the same Source, such as audio Flows with different numbers of tracks.
        Further guidance on when Flows/Sources may be considered the same/different may be found in the [Practical Guidance for Media](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-04/releases/v1.0.0/docs/3.0._Practical_Guidance_for_Media.html) section of AMWA MS-04.

        The examples provided here are for the "http_object_store" Storage Backend type which MUST include a `get_urls` property that contains the HTTP URLs for downloading the Media Object - service implementations should generate this internally.

        The Flow Segment may include timing adjustment information that the client needs to apply when extracting the samples from the Media Object.
        The timestamp of a sample on the Flow Segment's timeline (`segment_ts`) is the timestamp of that sample embedded in or derived from the internal timing of the Media Object (`media_object_ts`) adjusted by `ts_offset`: `segment_ts = media_object_ts + ts_offset`.

        It may also use a subset of the samples in the Media Object, and if the `include_object_timerange=true` parameter is set, the object's timerange will also be returned to aid identifying which samples to skip.

        Clients should use the pagination options to limit the results to a timerange and/or count.
        Service implementations may also limit the results returned.
        This will be signalled via the paging headers in the response.
        The list of Flow Segments can be empty.
        A request for Segments from a non-existent Flow will return an empty list, not a 404.

        Note that for codecs with temporal re-ordering, the timerange representes the _presentation_ timeline, and clients may need to check the `key_frame_count` property and/or read backwards from the start of the requested timerange to retrieve enough reference material to start decoding.

        When making requests to the provided `get_urls`, clients should include credentials if the provided URL is on the same origin as the API itself, akin to the `same-origin` mode in the [WhatWG Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode).

      summary: Create Flow Segments
      description: |
        Register either a single new Flow Segment or an array of Segments, attaching the Object id given to a point in the Flow timeline.

        The Segment may use a newly-written Media Object, or re-use an existing Media Object from another Flow.

        For newly-written Media Objects, the client is responsible for ensuring that the Segment written to the TAMS service instance obeys the following restrictions:
          - All samples in the Object SHOULD be used by the Segment.
          - If the Segment does not use all samples in the Object, `object_timerange` MUST be set to the timerange of media in the object, on the Media Object's timeline
          - The timestamps of each sample in the Media Object MUST equal its position on the Flow timeline, OR `ts_offset` MUST be set such that `media_object_ts + ts_offset = segment_ts`
          - The timerange of the Segment MUST NOT overlap any other Segment in the same Flow. The behaviour is undefined if there is an overlap with existing Segments and a service may return a 400 error response.

        A service instance SHOULD reject registrations of Flow Segments with a 400 error response if it references a newly created Media Object in the local TAMS storage that was not intended to be used for the Flow.
        A service instance SHOULD accept Flow Segments that reference an existing Media Object in the local TAMS storage that was originally created for another Flow.

        A service instance MAY support Media Objects that are held in external storage in another TAMS or other media storage system.
        The Flow Segment may in that case require the `get_urls` property to provide the information needed by clients to access the Media Object.

        The list of instances of an object (and associated `get_urls` entries) can be modified via the [`/objects`](#/operations/GET_objects) endpoints, which provides a mechanism to register new instances of an object.

        Clients MAY modify Flow Segments, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances to correct metadata such as `key_frame_count`, as such operations will likely break the idempotency of Segments.
        If a client needs to modify a Flow Segment, then the client SHOULD first delete the existing Segment and then write a new one.
        The behaviour is undefined if the Segment exists and the service may return a 400 error response.

        For successful creation of all Segments in the request a 201 response should be provided.
        If an error is detected when processing a list of Segments then processing should continue to try and process the remaining Segments.
        A 200 response should be returned listing the failed Segments.

        Clients are expected to decide how to break content into Media Objects, however those Objects SHOULD be large enough to avoid excessive round trip overheads in the underlying store (_e.g._ of the order of several megabytes) and where codecs with temporal re-ordering are used, Object SHOULD contain complete GOPs or decodable units.

        For Media Objects that have been re-used from other Flows, the `timerange` MAY specify only part of the duration of the object:
          - The `timerange` field indicates the new Segment's position in the Flow
          - The timerange of the Segment MUST NOT overlap any other Segment in the same Flow.
          - The Flow Segment's `timerange` start and end, once offset by `ts_offset`, MUST be contained entirely within the Media Object's `timerange`

        When re-using Media Objects, requests which change object properties (e.g. `key_frame_count` or `object_timerange`) SHOULD be rejected.

      description: |
        Request the service to create an Object instance on a new Storage Backend. Or add a new uncontrolled URL to `get_urls`.

        To request the duplication of the Object to a new Storage Backend, clients POST a `storage_id` to this endpoint that does not currently have an instance of the Object. The API will then:

        - Allocate storage for Media Object `objectId` on Storage Backend `storage_id`
        - Copy the Media Object from an existing location to the newly allocated storage
        - Start advertising the new copy in `get_urls` once ready

        The API instances SHOULD be capable of handling the case where the only existant instances are uncontrolled.

        Where a client has written a new uncontrolled Object instance, the client is responsible for ensuring that the Object written is complete and correct before registering it with this method.

        All instances of an Object MUST be identical.

        One of `storage_id` or `label` MUST be specified in the query parameters. `storage_id` SHOULD be used where `controlled` is `True` for the instance.

        API instances should remove the Media Object instance from the `get_urls` list and then, if the instance is controlled, delete the Object instance from storage.

        API instances SHOULD prevent clients from deleting all Object instances. Additionally, API instances MAY prevent clients from deleting all controlled Object instances. Where clients wish to remove all copies of an Object from the store, they should do so by deleting all Flows or Flow Segments which reference the Object.

      description: |
        HTTP basic authentication using a username and password.

        This option should only be used in constrained cases where Bearer tokens are impractical, since the password is intrinsically long-lived, and managing user credentials across systems is difficult compared to using centralised auth (e.g. via OAuth2) with Bearer tokens
    bearer_token_auth:

      description: |
        HTTP bearer token authentication.

        The method through which a client should acquire a bearer token is assumed to be an OAuth2 grant (either the Authorization Code or Client Credentials grant), however the OpenAPI `OAuth Flow` object cannot be used because it requires that the relevant URLs are known in advance.

        Clients should provide options to allow one (or both) grant types to be configured, as appropriate.

        Where tokens are not JWTs, or are acquired through some other mechanism, the API key method should be used instead.

      description: |
        URL token authentication.

        The method through which a client should acquire the token is not specified: it is assumed this takes place in another way, and a TAMS client may well be passed a URL to a TAMS service instance including the token.

        Clients should retain the token in the `access_token` query string parameter, and use it for subsequent requests to the TAMS service instance in the same session.
