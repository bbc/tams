More information about the error condition will be indicated by the service instance in the `error` parameter. Service implementations SHOULD implement appropriate retries and only enter the `error` state when absolutely necesary. A webhook in the `error` or `disabled` state may be re-enabled by a client by setting the status to `created`. A webhook in the `created` or `started` state may be disabled by a client by setting the status to `disabled`. Attempting to transition an `error` status to `disabled` SHOULD be rejected.",
