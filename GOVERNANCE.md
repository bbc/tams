# Governance

TAMS is in the process of migrating to a formal, open governance approach under a suitable governing body.
The project started out within BBC Research & Development, however a more formal approach is needed in the long term.
Care is required to select the right approach to support the TAMS community and ecosystem, so this document sets out the steps, goals and approximate timeline.

To enable this process, a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is formed and provides overall project guidance.
The TSC will be responsible for identifying, agreeing and implementing the governance process, while also managing the day-to-day arrangements of who has commit access to the repository.

## Goals

1. Ensure the longevity and stability of the TAMS API specification and associated ecosystem
2. Ensure that TAMS as a technology is owned by the community in general, rather than controlled by any one organisation
3. Create space to grow the community
4. Provide a framework to set project direction and facilitate technical decision making

## Phase 1: Setup Period (now)

Initially the TSC will be formed from several of the team at BBC R&D and AWS who were involved in TAMS becoming an industry initiative, balanced out by other organisations.
In the Setup Period, the TSC is charged with setting up an open governance process and identifying a suitable organisation to take control of the project.

This period is set out to give time for due diligence to identify the correct approach to take and organisation to join.
However the BBC commits this will end and a decision will be made and published in time for Phase 2 to begin by September 2026, although BBC R&D and the TSC hopes to finish this stage sooner!

After the TSC has agreed on the governance approach, this document will be updated to describe it, and the community will be informed.
In the meantime, suggestions and comments are greatly appreciated.

## Phase 2: Transition Period

Immediately after the completion of the Setup Period, the TSC will work to implement the approach that was decided.
This will involve any relevant project setup process with the organisation selected, and moving the TAMS repository out of the BBC’s GitHub Organisation.
In addition extra materials such as project charters and codes of conduct will be written.
Resources such as the project website will become managed by the project as well, rather than by the individuals and organisations who created them.

During this Phase, the shape of the TSC will be finalised and the membership will change accordingly, striking a balance between members of the technology vendor and technology user communities.
As part of this, some members will relinquish their seats (and accompanying voting rights) such that each organisation only has one vote.

The BBC expects the TAMS repository to move to a new organisation owner by IBC 2026, and this phase will complete shortly afterwards once the plan decided in Phase 1 has been fully implemented and the TSC transition has completed.

## Phase 3: Open Governance

In the final phase, the transition to open governance has been completed and a steady state has been reached, where the TSC continues to govern and steer the TAMS project.
Membership of the TSC will be decided by the Committee itself, using the overarching rules of the organisation under which TAMS sits to manage adding and removing members.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for all technical oversight of the project and managing the roadmap.

### Composition and Evolution

Initially the TSC has been drawn from the individuals heavily involved in the development and promotion of TAMS: as such some members work for the same organisation.
After the Setup Period and during the Transition Period (following IBC 2026, or earlier as agreed by the TSC) some of these members will relinquish their seats and accompanying voting rights such that each organisation has only one vote.

In general the TSC may adjust choose to adjust it’s own membership throughout.

### Leadership

The TSC may elect a Chair.
The Chair serves until resignation or replacement by the TSC.
In the Chair’s absence they may nominate a deputy, or the TSC may temporarily nominate a Chair for a given session.

### Responsibilities

In general, the TSC is responsible for:

- Coordinating the technical direction of TAMS
- Facilitating technical decision making
- Managing roles within the project, including who has commit access to the repository
- Establishing community norms, workflows, release processes, and security policies
- Deciding how any certification or compatibility programme operates
- Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the project.

To aid in decision making, a set of principles guiding what TAMS is and how it develops are set out in [PRINCIPLES.md](./PRINCIPLES.md)

Furthermore during the Setup and Transition Periods, the TSC is charged with:

- Finding a suitable legal and administrative framework through which the project should operate
- Transferring ownership of the repository and the "TAMS" name (plus any associated marks and assets as relevant) to the future governance framework
- Devising an approach to the project’s infrastructure and necessary funding (such as domains, hosting and events)
- Strengthening the TAMS community, and devising appropriate spaces and forums for that to take place
- Setting out roles within the project and how those roles are assumed
- Defining how contributions are handled under the new framework
- Setting out the shape of membership of the TSC following the Setup Period
- Publishing a suitable Code of Conduct for the project

### Meetings

The TSC meets fortnightly online, at a time to suit the availability of the members.
Meetings are open (however only TSC members may vote on matters put to a vote).
Contact any member of the TSC for a copy of the invitation.

### Voting and Decision-Making

The TSC strives for consensus.
If voting is needed:

- One vote per TSC member.
- Quorum is 50% of voting members.
- Votes at meetings require a majority of voting members present.
  Electronic votes outside of a meeting require a majority of all TSC members.

### TSC Members

The TSC is intended to be a balanced mixture of members from the community of technology vendors, of broadcasters and customers of TAMS, alongside the BBC R&D team working to evolve TAMS across the board.
It is expected this mix will change in time.

At the time of writing, the TSC membership is still being identified, and we would like to hear from individuals interested in joining.
This sets out a broad shape of the group:

- Sam Mesterton-Gibbons (BBC)
- James Sandford (BBC)
- Richard Lynton-Evans (BBC)
- John Biltcliffe (AWS)
- Chris Swan (AWS)
- `<Another broadcaster/content owner/user organisation>`
- `<A vendor organisation>`
